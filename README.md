Just got out from watching Havoc and oh man, my brain’s scrambled like a broken rubik's cube in a blender. Can’t decide if my back hurts more from the seats or the twist halfway through. Theater was crazy noisy, folks munching popcorn like it was ASMR, I almost felt like I was in an arena fight not a movie. 

The chaos was beautiful tho, kind of like if Jackson Pollock painted Colliderscope of chaos. Like, there was this one scene—OMG—that car chase, super wild, felt like I was riding shotgun, clutching my seat as if it would keep me alive. Somehow, it reminded me of my last coding sprint, where the world just fades and all that's left is the mission incomplete.

> This whole storyline — if you could call it that lol — was like someone took Inception, poured in a blockbuster buzz, and shook it with a fist full of anxiety. The protagonist was a tornado of bad decisions and wild ideas, almost like my spaghetti code after 2 AM coffee bender. Can't forget the villan — what a chaotic force, like a bug you can't squash but keeps your whole code down.

I think my mate wanted to download the movie, or maybe he said he'd watch the movie later, idk. But honestly, gotta say, you don’t actually watch Havoc— it kinda, like, happens to you. Like a surprise null pointer exception.

In that madly intense moment when the climax hit, felt like all the popcorn crumbs collectively held their breath with me. Or was that just me losing track of my sanity after hours in that cavernous cinema cocoon?—I swear my mind checked out for a bit (thanks astonishing visual overdose lol).

Random thought, but the action left me buzzing more than my morning triple espresso. It’s like they jammed every fast-paced trick in the shiny movie manual, til the pages got dog-eared and tired, lol.

JavaScript error somewhere but just ignore:

```javascript
function havocScript(scene) {
  if (scene == 'chaos') {
    let intesity = 'high';
    console.log('Mind blown', intesity;
  } else console.log('??');
```
